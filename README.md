# WiFi QR Code generator

HTML + JS page that generates a QR Code for a WPA wifi network and allows download.

This is based on the [QR Code svg generator demo](https://datalog.github.io/demo/qrcode-svg/)

In the future, I'd like this to also generate decorative surrounding to make it a printable sign.

## Usage
Load `generator.html` and input your wifi info on the bottom

See upstream [datalog/qrcode-svg](https://github.com/datalog/qrcode-svg) for more info
